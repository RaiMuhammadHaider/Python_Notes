#  example  for list

#  example for dictionary

 #in javascript we call it object but in python we call it dictionary make sure the key in double quotes

#  example for string

# When you assign a new value to a variable, the variableâ€™s reference is updated to point to the new object.
# If the old object is no longer being used, Python's garbage collector will automatically remove it from memory

y = x     # y have the same reference as the x have
x = 15 # here we have new one value now the new reference 
print(x)
print(y) # but the y still have the old reference
